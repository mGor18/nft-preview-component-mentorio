## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

- Implementing CSS Variables
- More indepth use of flexbox
- Utilizing span elements more in conjunction with CSS for more specific and difficult design changes (ex. multiple text colors in the same line)
- Better understanding how important workflow is and fine-tuning my own process before getting my hands dirty on the actually build.
